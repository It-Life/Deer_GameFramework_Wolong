With blazing fast pathfinding your AIs will be able to find the player in complex mazes in no time at all.\nPerfect for TD, FPS and RTS games.\nFeatures:\nSupports grid, navmesh, point and hexagonal graphs. Automatic navmesh generation to save you from doing it manually. Fully multithreaded so it will barely affect the frame rate. Path post-processing using raycasting, smoothing and using the funnel algorithm. A single line of code for a pathfinding call. Graphs can be saved to files. Local Avoidance both in the XZ and XY plane. Source code included. Supports updating graphs during runtime.",
